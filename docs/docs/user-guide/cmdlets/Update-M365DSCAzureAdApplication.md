# Update-M365DSCAzureAdApplication

## Description

This function creates or updates an application in Azure AD. It assigns permissions,
grants consent and creates a secret or uploads a certificate to the application.

This application can then be used for Application Authentication.

The provided permissions have to be as an array of hashtables, with Api=Graph, SharePoint
or Exchange and PermissionsName set to a list of permissions. See examples for more information.

NOTE:
Please make sure you have the following permissions for the 'Microsoft Graph Command Line Tools'
Enterprise Application in your tenant:

- Application.ReadWrite.All

You can add this scope to the 'Microsoft Graph Command Line Tools' Enterprise Application by running
the following command:

```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'Application.ReadWrite.All'
```

NOTE:
If consent cannot be given for whatever reason, make sure all these permissions are
given Admin Consent by browsing to the App Registration in Azure AD > API Permissions
and clicking the "Grant admin consent for <orgname>" button.
